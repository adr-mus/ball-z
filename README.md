# Ball-Z

Final project for the course 'Effective programming in Python'.
The aim was to implement an Arkanoid-style game. 

Run main.py to start the game. 

Additional controls:
- R (on start screen): open the ranking,
- P (in game): pause/unpause the game,
- Esc: exit to the start screen, exit game if already there.
